             of gas and dust. Gravitational attraction holds the planets in their elliptical orbits 
             around the Sun. In addition to Earth, five major planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, 
             and Saturn) have been known from ancient times. Since then only two more have been 
             discovered: Uranus by accident in 1781 and Neptune in 1846 after a deliberate search 
             following a theoretical prediction based on observed irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. 
             Pluto, discovered in 1930 after a search for a planet predicted to lie beyond Neptune, was
              considered a major planet until 2006, when it was redesignated a dwarf planet by the 
              International Astronomical Union.
