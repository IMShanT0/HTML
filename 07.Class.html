                Mars is the fourth planet that orbits the Sun in our Solar System. Circling at an average 
                distance of approximately 229 million kilometres (around 142 million miles) from the Sun, 
                it sits between the orbits of Earth and Jupiter.The planet is a terrestrial or 'rocky' body
                 with complex geological characteristics and even signs that liquid water, if not glaciers, 
                 have at some point eroded its surface.
                Despite many similarities between Earth and Mars, Mars has had a significantly different history
                 to our own planet.Known as the 'Red Planet', Mars' rust-coloured appearance really sets it apart, 
                 and that might have something to do with its smaller size.
                The planet has roughly one-tenth of our own planet's mass and about half of its diameter.

            <p class="planet_desc" >In the last 260 million years, dinosaurs came and went, Pangea split into the continents 
                and islands we see today, and humans have quickly and irreversibly changed the world we live 
                in.But through all of that, it seems Earth has been keeping time. A new study of ancient
                 geological events suggests that our planet has a slow, steady 'heartbeat' of geological 
                 activity every 27 million years or so.
    
                This pulse of clustered geological events - including volcanic activity, mass extinctions,
                 plate reorganizations and sea level rises - is incredibly slow, a 27.5-million-year cycle 
                 of catastrophic ebbs and flows. But luckily for us, the research team notes we have another 
                 20 million years before the next 'pulse'.
                "Many geologists believe that geological events are random over time," said Michael Rampino, 
                a New York University geologist and the study's lead author.

                Earth is not the only world adorned with the glowing atmospheric phenomenon that is aurora.
                 In fact, in a Solar System aurora competition, the clear winner would be Jupiter. The 
                 so-called King of Planets is crowned with the most powerful auroras in the Solar System, 
                 permanently circling both its poles.
                Because they glow only in non-visible wavelengths, we can't see them with the naked eye, 
                so it wasn't until just 40 years ago that they were discovered. Ever since, scientists have
                 wondered how these auroras produce periodic bursts of X-radiation.
                Now, they think they've solved it. Using simultaneous observations from Jupiter probe Juno 
                and X-ray space observatory XMM-Newton, a team led by planetary scientist Zhonghua Yao of the
                 Chinese Academy of Sciences in China has linked the X-ray bursts to vibrations in the gas
                  giant's magnetic field lines.
